# Notes App (React Native)

This is a simple notes app built with React Native. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes and store them using [Appwrite](https://apwr.dev/traversyfeb2025). It also uses authentication through Appwrite to allow users to sign up and log in and create private notes.

This project goes with my React Native Mini-Course on YouTube.
